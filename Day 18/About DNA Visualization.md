# Introduction
Deoxyribonucleic acid is a tiny molecule that exists in every cell of our bodies and contains the blueprint for how our bodies grow. It looks like a double helix (a sort of twisted ladder) of pairs of nucleotide molecules: guanine, cytosine, adenine, and thymine. These are represented by the letters G, C, A, and T. DNA is a long molecule; itâ€™s microscopic, but if it were stretched out, its 3 billion base pairs would be 2 meters long! This program is a simple animation of DNA.

# How does DNA Visualization work?
This program creates a scrolling animation by printing strings from the ROWS list. The AT and CG pairs are inserted into each string with the format() string method.

# What did we learn?
DNA Visualization helps us to understand about:

1. Concept of class in Python
2. The __init__() method
