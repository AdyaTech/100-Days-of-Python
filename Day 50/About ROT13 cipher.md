# Introduction
The ROT13 cipher, one of the simplest encryption algorithms, represents the letters A to Z as the numbers 0 to 25 in such a way that the encrypted letter is 13 spaces from the plaintext letter: A becomes N, B becomes O, and so on. 

The encryption process is identical to the decryption process, making it trivial to program. However, the encryption is also trivial to break. 

Because of this, you’ll most often find ROT13 used to conceal non-sensitive information, such as spoilers or trivia answers, so it’s not read unintentionally.
