# Introduction
Do you think the most complex use of the random module in Python is random sampling? No, we can also generate random stories or anything beyond that using the random module.

# How Does the Story Generator Work?
Our task is to generate a random story every time the user runs the program. I will first store the parts of the stories in different lists, then the Random module can be used to select the random parts of the story stored in different lists.

# What did we learn?
Story Generator helps us to understand about:

1. Concept of lists
2. Random module
