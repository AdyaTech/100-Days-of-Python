# Introduction
The Caesar Cipher is an ancient encryption algorithm used by Julius Caesar. It encrypts letters by shifting them over by a certain number of places in the alphabet. For example, if the key is 3, then A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes F, and so on. To decrypt the message, you must shift the encrypted letters in the opposite direction. This program lets the user encrypt and decrypt messages according to this algorithm. 

# How Does the Caesar Cipher Work?
Like most cipher programs, the Caesar Cipher works by translating characters into numbers, performing some math operations on those numbers and translating the numbers back into text characters. In the context of ciphers, we call these text characters symbols.
