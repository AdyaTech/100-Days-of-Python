# Introduction
In this version of the song “Ninety-Nine Bottles,” the program introduces small imperfections in each stanza by either removing a letter, swapping the casing of a letter, transposing two letters, or doubling a letter.

As the song continues to play, these mutations add up, resulting in a very silly song.
