# Introduction
This simulation shows a forest whose trees are constantly growing and then being burned down. On each step of the simulation, there is a 1 percent chance that a blank space grows into a tree and a 1 percent chance that a tree is struck by lightning and burns. 

Fires will spread to adjacent trees, so a densely packed forest is more likely to suffer a larger fire than a sparsely packed one.
