# Introduction
The Fibonacci sequence is a famous mathematical pattern credited to Italian mathematician Fibonacci in the 13th century (though others had discovered it even earlier). 

The sequence begins with 0 and 1, and the next number is always the sum of the previous two numbers. The sequence continues forever.
