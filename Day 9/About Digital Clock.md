# Introduction
The great part of creating your own GUI apps is that you can customize them however you want. From text font to background colour, all features are available for customization. In this project, I have created a Digital Clock using Python.

# How Does the Digital Clock Work?
To create a Digital Clock, first define the title and size of the application. Then, define the font of the time, its color, its border width and the background color of the digital clock. Finally, combine all the elements to define the label of the clock application.

In the end, define the main function of the digital clock and set the text of the label as the realtime. 

# What did we learn?
Digital Clock helps us to understand about the Tkinter library in Python.
