# Introduction
If you are of a certain age, you’ll remember those ancient technological devices called DVD players. When not playing DVDs, they would display a diagonally traveling DVD logo that bounced off the edges of the screen.  

This program simulates this colorful DVD logo by making it change direction each time it hits an edge. We’ll also keep track of how many times a logo hits a corner of the screen.

# How Does the Bouncing DVD Work?
You may remember Cartesian coordinates from your math class in school. In programming, the x-coordinate represents an object’s horizontal position and the y-coordinate represents its vertical position, just like in mathematics. 

However, unlike in mathematics, the origin point (0, 0) is in the upper-left corner of the screen, and the y-coordinate increases as you go down. The x-coordinate increases as the object moves right, just like in mathematics. 

# What did we learn?
