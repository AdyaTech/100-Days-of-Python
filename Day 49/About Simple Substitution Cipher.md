# Introduction
Hiding some data to protect it from unauthorized access is known as Encryption. When plain text is encrypted, it becomes unreadable and is known as ciphertext. 

In a Substitution cipher, any character of plain text from the given fixed set of characters is substituted by some other character from the same set depending on a key. 

For example, with a shift/key of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C and so on.
