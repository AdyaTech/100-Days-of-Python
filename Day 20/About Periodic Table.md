A .csv, or comma-separated values, file is a text file that represents a primitive spreadsheet. Each line in the .csv file is a row, and commas separate the columns.

Python’s csv module makes it easy to import data from a .csv file. The rest of the program can easily summon the information by an element’s name or atomic number.
