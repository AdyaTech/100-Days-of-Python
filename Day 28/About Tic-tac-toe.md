# Introduction
Tic-tac-toe is a classic pencil-and-paper game played on a 3 × 3 grid. Players take turns placing their X or O marks, trying to get three in a row. Most games of tic-tac-toe end in a tie, but it is possible to outsmart your opponent if they’re not careful.

# How does Tic-tac-toe work?
To represent tic-tac-toe boards in this program, we use a dictionary with keys '1' through '9' for the spaces on the board. The numbered spaces are arranged in the same way as a phone’s keypad. 

The values in this dictionary are the string 'X' or 'O' for a player’s mark and ' ' for an empty space.
