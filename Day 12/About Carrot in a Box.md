# Introduction
This is a simple and silly bluffing game for two human players. Each player has a box. One box has a carrot in it, and each player wants to have the carrot. The first player looks in their box and then tells the second player they either do or don’t have the carrot. The second player gets to decide whether to swap boxes or not.

# How to Play?
This program relies on the second player closing their eyes so they don’t see the contents of the first player’s box. In order to keep the second player from seeing the box contents after this step, we need to find a way to clear the screen. This keeps the second player from accidentally seeing what was only intended for the first player. 

While the second player could always scroll up to see this text, it’d be obvious to the first player, who’s sitting right next to them, that they had done so.
