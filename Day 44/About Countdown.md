# Introduction
This program displays a digital timer that counts down to zero. Rather than render numeric characters directly, the http://sevseg.py module from “Seven-Segment Display Module,” generates the drawings for each digit. 

You must create this file before the Countdown program can work. Then, set the countdown timer to any number of seconds, minutes, and hours you like.
