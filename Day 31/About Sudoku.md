# Introduction
Sudoku is a popular puzzle game in newspapers and mobile apps. The Sudoku board is a 9 × 9 grid in which the player must place the digits 1 to 9 once, and only once, in each row, column, and 3 × 3 subgrid. The game begins with a few spaces already filled in with digits, called givens. A well-formed Sudoku puzzle will have only one possible valid solution.
