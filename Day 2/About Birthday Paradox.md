# Introduction
How many people do you share a birthday with? For many years, I didn't know anyone who shared my birthday, but as my group of acquaintances expanded, so too did the probability that at least some of them would share the same date of birth. Now I know at least five other people with the same birthday date as mine.  

# How Does the Birthday Paradox Work?
Let's assume a group of 70 people. There’s a 99.9 percent chance of two people having a matching birthday. But even in a group as small as 23 people, there’s a 50 percent chance of a matching birthday. 

This program performs several probability experiments to determine the percentages for groups of different sizes having the same birthday dates and getting caught in Birthday Paradox. 

# What did we learn?
Birthday Paradox helps us to understand about:

1. Probability Theory
2. Concept of Exponents
