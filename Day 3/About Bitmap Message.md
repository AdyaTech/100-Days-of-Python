# Introduction
A **bitmap** is an array of binary data representing the values of pixels in an image. This program uses a multiline string as a bitmap to determine how it should display a message from the user.

# How Does the Bitmap Message Work?
In this bitmap, space characters represent an empty space and all other characters are replaced by characters in the user’s message. The provided bitmap resembles a world map, but you can change this to any image you’d like.

Try experimenting with different messages to see what the results look like!

# What did we learn?
Bitmap Message helps us to understand about:

1. The bitmap concept
2. The bitmap.splitlines() method
3. Using a multiline string
