# Introduction
When you roll two six-sided dice, there’s a 17 percent chance you’ll roll a 7. That’s much better than the odds of rolling a 2: just 3 percent. 

That’s because there’s only one combination of dice rolls that gives you 2 (the one that occurs when both dice roll a 1), but many combinations add up to seven: 1 and 6, 2 and 5, 3 and 4, and so on.
