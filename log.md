### Day 1: 1st January, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about:

2. The random.shuffle() Function
3. The sort() and join() List Methods
4. String Interpolation (also called String Formatting)
5. Conversion Specifier (%s)
6. Nested Loops.

**Thoughts:** Successfully made a deductive logic game called **Bagels** in which you must guess a secret three-digit number based on clues.
