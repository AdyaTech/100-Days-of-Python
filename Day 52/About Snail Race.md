# Introduction
You wonâ€™t be able to handle the fast-paced excitement of these racing . . . snails. Each snail (represented by an @ character for the shell and v for the two eyestalks) moves slowly but surely toward the finish line. 

Up to eight snails, each with a custom name, can race each other, leaving a slime trail in their wake.
