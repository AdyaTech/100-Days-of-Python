# Introduction
This short program produces a tessellated image of a hexagonal grid, similar to chicken wire. It shows that you donâ€™t need a lot of code to make something interesting.

The power behind programming is that it can make a computer carry out repetitive instructions quickly and without mistakes. This is how a dozen lines of code can create hundreds, thousands, or millions of hexagons on the screen.
