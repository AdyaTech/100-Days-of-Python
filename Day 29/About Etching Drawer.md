# Introduction
When you move a pen point around the screen with the WASD keys, the etching drawer forms a picture by tracing a continuous line, like the Etch A Sketch toy. Let your artistic side break out and see what images you can create! 

This program also lets you save your drawings to a text file so you can print them out later.
