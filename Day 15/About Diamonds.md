# Introduction
This program features a small algorithm for drawing ASCII-art diamonds of various sizes. It contains functions for drawing either an outline or filled-in-style diamond of the size you dictate. These functions are good practice for a beginner; try to understand the pattern behind the diamond drawings as they increase in size.

# How does Diamonds work?
A helpful approach to creating this program yourself is to “draw” diamonds of several sizes in your editor first and then figure out the pattern they follow as the diamond gets bigger. This technique will help you realize that each row of an outline diamond has four parts: the number of leading spaces, the exterior forward slash, the number of interior spaces, and the exterior backslash. Filled diamonds have several interior forward slashes and backslashes rather than interior spaces.
