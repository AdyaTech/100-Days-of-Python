# Introduction
A progress bar is a visual element that shows how much of a task has been completed. Progress bars are often used alongside downloading files or software installations.  

# How does Progress Bar work?
This project creates a getProgressBar() function that returns a progress bar string based on the arguments passed to it. It simulates a downloading file, but you can reuse the progress bar code in your own projects.
