# Introduction
Piet Mondrian was a 20th-century Dutch painter and one of the founders of neoplasticism, an abstract art movement. His most iconic paintings relied on blocks of primary colors (blue, yellow, red), black, and white. Using a minimalist approach, he separated these colors with horizontal and vertical elements.
