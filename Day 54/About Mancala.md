# Introduction
The board game Mancala is at least 2,000 years old. It is a “seed-sowing” game in which two players select pockets of seeds to spread across the other pockets on the board while trying to collect as many in their store as possible. 

There are several variants of this game across different cultures. The name comes from the Arab word naqala, meaning “to move.”

# How does Mancala work?
Mancala uses ASCII art to display the board. Notice that each pocket needs to have not only the number of seeds in it but a label as well.

To play, grab the seeds from a pit on your side of the board and place one in each subsequent pit, going counterclockwise and skipping your opponent’s store.

If your last seed lands in an empty pit of yours, move the opposite pit’s seeds into that pit. If the last placed seed is in your store, you get a free turn.
