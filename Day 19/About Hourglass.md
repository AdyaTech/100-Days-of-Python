# Introduction
This visualization program has a rough physics engine that simulates sand falling through the small aperture of an hourglass. The sand piles up in the bottom half of the hourglass; then the hourglass is turned over so the process repeats.    

# How does DNA Visualization work?
The hourglass program implements a rudimentary physics engine. A physics engine is software that simulates physical objects falling under gravity, colliding with each other, and moving according to the laws of physics.
