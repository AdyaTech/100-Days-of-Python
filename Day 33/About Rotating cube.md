# Introduction
This project features an animation of a 3D cube rotating using trigonometric functions. You can adapt the 3D point rotation math and the line() function in your own animation programs.

# How does Rotating Cube work?
Although the block text characters we’ll use to draw the cube don’t look like thin, straight lines, this kind of drawing is called a wireframe model because it renders only the edges of an object’s surfaces.
