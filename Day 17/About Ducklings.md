# Introduction
This program creates a scrolling field of ducklings. Each duckling has slight variations: they can face left or right and have two different body sizes, four types of eyes, two types of mouths and three positions for their wings. This gives us 96 different possible variations, which the Ducklings program produces endlessly.

# How does Ducklings work?
This program represents ducklings with a Duckling class. The random features of each ducking are chosen in the __init__() method of this class, while the various body parts of each duckling are returned by the getHeadStr(), getBodyStr(), and getFeetStr() methods.

# What did we learn?
Ducklings helps us to understand about:

1. Concept of class in Python
2. The __init__() method
