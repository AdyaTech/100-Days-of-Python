# Introduction
Our website needs to trick people into looking at advertisements! But coming up with creative, original content is too hard. Luckily, with the clickbait headline generator, we can make a computer come up with millions of outrageous fake headlines. 

# How does Clickbait work?
This program has several functions for generating different kinds of clickbait headlines. Each of them gets random words from STATES, NOUNS, PLACES, WHEN, and other lists. The functions then insert these words into a template string with the format() string method before returning this string. 

This is like a “Mad Libs” activity book, except the computer fills in the blanks, allowing the program to generate thousands of clickbait headlines in seconds.

# What did we learn?
